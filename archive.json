As a result, an error code is returned with the nonce endpoint details and the client is then expected to interact with the nonce endpoint, obtain a new nonce, and then retry the request with the nonce.\r\n\r\n- [x] The document should describe a flow that would allow the client to initially go directly to the nonce endpoint to obtain a nonce before contacting the server, to avoid the error case. (see: https://github.com/peppelinux/draft-demarco-nonce-endpoint/pull/15)\r\n\r\n- [ ] the document should describe a flow that would allow a valid response to a request with a valid nonce to return a new nonce that could be used with subsequent requests to avoid the need for a new request to the nonce endpoint, as an optimization to reduce latency in load situations.\r\n\r\n- [x] The document should also add this new endpoint to the \"OAuth Authorization Server Metadata\" registry.

The nonce may very well be a random unique opaque value that the Authorization Server stores at least until it's validity time expires. Every time the Authorization Server \"sees\" a nonce (included on any request) it MUST retrieve it from storage and mark it as \"used\" so subsequent requests can't include that same nonce.\r\n\r\nIf the nonce can't be found on storage it means it wasn't originally minted by the server or it has expired and a `nonce_required` error MUST be returned to the client. If the server wants the nonce to NOT be an opaque string it's fine to do so (this SHOULD be an implementation detail). Similar to how `access_token`s on OAuth2.0 are meant to be opaque but there also exists a [JWT profile](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068) for them.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, the spec MAY be simplified by removing the requirements related to encryption and the non-normative examples of nonce payloads.",

Non-normative Examples of a Nonce Payload](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-demarco-oauth-nonce-endpoint-00.html#name-non-normative-examples-of-a) the following nonce payload is shown as example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"iss\": \"https://server.example.org\",\r\n  \"iat\": 1615908701,\r\n  \"exp\": 1615995101,\r\n  \"source_endpoint\": \"https://server.example.org/nonce-endpoint\",\r\n  \"aud\": [\r\n    \"https://service.example.com/endpoint\",\r\n    \"https://another.example.com/cb\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf an Authorization Server encrypts a payload such as this to obtain a nonce it could end up generating non-unique values if multiple requests are served at the same time (second). The only claims in this JSON object that are subject to change are `iat` and `exp`, which are defined as [NumericDate](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-2) (A JSON numeric value representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time, ignoring leap seconds.).\r\n\r\nSince uniqueness is a hard requirement for nonces to fulfill their intended purpose, I think it would be best if this non-normative example includes some actual random value (such as the `jti` claim with a UUID for example).",
